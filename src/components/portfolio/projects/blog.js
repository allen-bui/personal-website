  description: `Giving myself a week to build anything I wanted, this blog project came about. I built custom user authentication from scratch, where a user can register, login, and see the posts they've created. The posts are saved in a a MySQL database and retrieved when a user logs into their account. It took me a week to complete the minimum viable product (MVP, no styling) and I was happy with it, but I decided to sprinkle on some CSS to make it look and feel like an actual blog.`,
