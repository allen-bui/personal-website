  description: `This project stemmed from wanting to educate the world a little bit more in a fun way. I couldn't find any cool trivia apps online, so I built my own! I recently learned TypeScript, React Hooks, and SASS – so I built this application using those technologies because I wanted to reinforce my learning. I'm really happy with the way it turned out and plan to add the following features in the future – a timer per question, categories, and more animations. Stay tuned!`,
