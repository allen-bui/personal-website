  description: `This project is a recreation of Airbnb's item description page for their new Airbnb PLUS program. The goal was to familiarize myself with the React framework and styling components in CSS. I ran into many challenges with this project, but I learned a ton reading through documentation, Google searches, and Stack Overflow. Check out the project by clicking below and playing with the website yourself, or click the Github icon to see the repo. I hope you like it, any feedback is greatly appreciated!`,
